# API Portfolio Project
This project demonstrates API coding best practices using Python and FastAPI.

This project was built from examples from the book 
 [Hands-On APIs For API and Data Science](https://handsonapibook.com/).

 Will use data from my current company for the project.
 For practice purposes I will copy the project to local disk.
